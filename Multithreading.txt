Thread th1 = Thread.currentThread();		//Returns object of the current running thread.
th1.getName();					//Will return the current running thread name.

OR;

Thread.currentThread().getName();		//Will return the current running thread name.


Each thread in java is an object.

run() : Method is very important as it is the starting point of each thread execution.
start() : Thread class method is used to start the thread.

when a thread is started using start() method, its corresponding run() method gets executed. When task within run() method is completed, thread stops its execution. So, we can say the task related to the thread is given inside the run method.

main()		//Main thread
{
mth1.join() ; //Main thread says : I will wait for mth1 to complete its task and join me.
}


thread1 (is running)
{
	thread2.join();		//thread1 will wait for thread2 to complete its task then only thread1 will 					//proceed further.
}


sleep() : Static method of Thread class which takes current running thread to sleep/idle mode for the specified time period.

ex:
sleep(1000);	//Thread will sleep for 1 second; 

1 second = 1000 ms
